Description: ASSIGN is a computational tool to evaluate the pathway
    deregulation/activation status in individual patient samples.
    ASSIGN employs a flexible Bayesian factor analysis approach
    that adapts predetermined pathway signatures derived either
    from knowledge-based literature or from perturbation
    experiments to the cell-/tissue-specific pathway signatures.
    The deregulation/activation level of each context-specific
    pathway is quantified to a score, which represents the extent
    to which a patient sample encompasses the pathway
    deregulation/activation signature.
